I made this simple overview kanban board at the start of my project to order my steps.

Risk Assessment 

Before starting a new project, it is important to identify, analyse and solve any potential risks that can occur.

ERD

For the theme of the project, I chose a topic of interest for me. This being cinema. I decided to create a director database which stores information
about directors. The most basic information being their name and their work. The tables show that a director can have many movies, however a movie can only
have one director. This one to many relationship is illustrated below.
